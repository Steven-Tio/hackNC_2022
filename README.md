Hook: A Fishing Game -- "Hook" is a short game about fishing. It aims to bring awareness about endangered freshwater fish in North America. The main mechanic is that you "button-mash" in order to successfully catch a fish within a designated time frame. If you fail, the fish swims away. If you succeed, you catch a rare fish and learn more about it. Catch all the fish, and, well... let's just say overfishing is a mechanic in this game too. We hope this game helps people recognize how cool fish are!
